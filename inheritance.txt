Inheritance
Inheritance allows one class (child) to reuse the properties and methods of another class (parent).

Example:
class Dog extends Animal → Dog inherits from Animal.
 Method Overriding
When a child class redefines a method from the parent class with the same name and parameters.

Purpose:
To change or customize the inherited method’s behavior.

Example:

dart
Copy
Edit
class Animal {
  void sound() => print("Animal sound");
}

class Cat extends Animal {
  @override
  void sound() => print("Meow");
}
Method Overloading (Simulated in Dart)
Having multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.

Note:
Dart doesn't support overloading directly, but you can simulate it using optional or named parameters.

Example:

dart
Copy
Edit
void greet(String name, [int? age]) {
  print("Hello $name");
  if (age != null) print("You are $age years old");
}
